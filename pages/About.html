      <div class="about-main">
        <p>Born in 2002 at Ramgarh Cantt India, lived there for 19 years before moving to Winnipeg Canada. Spending all of my childhood and teenage years living in a joint family helped me alot in cooperating with people and growing up in a small town with a lot of siblings helped to build competitive behaviour.</br></br></br>During my senior secondary school years At Army Public School, I was introduced to various computer languages like python and HTML and to data softwares like MY SQL. I found working with these languages plain sailing as it was easier for me to understand the basics of the language which sparked the curiosity of learning more about them and pursuing a career in it.</br></br></br>Latest technological advancements into the mobile tech world have always been my topic of interest when it comes to what I enjoy the most in. Being constantly updated with all the latest trends of this industry as well as trying a lot of these compact pieces of technological marvellous has been my hobby, with some occasional games of football supporting my favourite team PSG (Paris Saint-Germain Football Club). With way lot of passionate about capturing nature and the environment around me. Keeping my traditional roots strong and on a mission to live life to its fullest.</br></p>
