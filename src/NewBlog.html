  <h1 class="heading-blog">Password Management</h1>
  <p>By - Bint Budwal</p>

  <div class="blog-content">
  
  
    <p>Password management is a set of best practices and rules to be followed by the users while they create, store and manage passwords in a systematic order to keep them secure from unwanted hunters.</p>
    
    <h2 class="blog-heading1">Why be serious about password management?</h2>
  
    <p>In an age of the internet where we have 100’s of accounts from social media to online banking, it is very difficult to remember good 100’s passwords. This creates a problem where we tend to make weak passwords that are very easy to get accessed and bypassed. Which all together affects our online security and presence.</p>
  
    <h2 class="blog-heading1">Why protect yourself?</h2>
    <p>On average, a cyber attack occurs every 39 seconds, which is alarming to our digital lives.</b>We need to take all possible steps to protect ourselves. Since most of the breaches involve weak and compromised credentials (like using easy-to-guess passwords ‘12345’ or ‘password’).</p>

    <h2 class="blog-heading1">Security precautions needed to be followed.</h2>

    
    
    <p>Creating secure passwords: creating long, complex, unique, and less personal passwords reduce the chance of getting hacked or passwords being compromised and harder to crack.</b>Using Multi-Factor Authentication: Using biometrics instead of text password and a password manager to keep them encrypted.</b>Not using the same passwords over and over and changing passwords on all accounts regularly.</p>
      

    <h2 class="blog-heading1">Few key things to keep in mind while maintaining an active life on the internet.</h2>
    <p>Not using common guessable passwords and using the same passwords.</p>

    <p>Staying  up-to-date with various types of frauds and scams</p>

    <h2 class="blog-heading1">No if’s, no buts</h2>
    <p>The slightest mishap or carelessness can land you in great trouble. Your banking details can go public, making you lose all your money or someone can get into your account see what you have been up to and impersonate you with your id causing you trouble.</b></p>
    <p>At last to make accounts easier to secure one can do all the security precautions mentioned above or can use a reputed password manager to do most of the bulky work to be done by it. </b></p>
