    <p>I am going to explain the simplest way to score when batting. Let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture first.</b></p> 

    <p>The goal of batting is to score runs, so let's look at the best batting strategy to achieve goals.</b></p>
    <p>Each batsman makes a tactical decision every time he faces a ball and decides what shot, if any, to play at it.
    </b>The first decision a batsman makes is whether to shift on to the front foot or back foot.

    <p>This decision is usually made based on the line and length of the ball. Bowlers initiate play by bowling to the batter, the bowler wants to control line and length so that he can create pressure to dismiss the batter. The batsman's goal is to manipulate the bowler’s line and length to create space on the field to score.</b></p>
    <p>The key to batting is the rotation of strike. While batting, both batsmen must face the ball by alternating the strike between them. After they run a single (1 run), the other batsman faces the bowling. By rotation of strike, the bowlers are not allowed to settle down into a fixed rhythm as they have to change their line and length to each striker.</b></p>
    
    <p>Once committed to afoot, the batsman must decide whether to:</p>
    <p>*Not play at the ball</b></p>
    <p>*Play a defensive shot.</b></p>
    <p>*Play an attacking shot</b></p>
    <p>*Actively evade the ball</b></p>
    <p> This decision is made based on several factors, the most important being: the batsman's confidence in his ability at the current time; the state of the game, and whether it is more appropriate to attack or defend.</p>

    <p>Many of these will conflict with each other, and the batsman must weigh them all in his mind to set his general approach as he bats. Constantly updating one’s strategy as the game develops.</p>
    <p></b>Batting accordingly will help a lot in developing a good style which will ultimately make you good at the game </p>
